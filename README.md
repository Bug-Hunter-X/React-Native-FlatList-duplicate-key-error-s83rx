This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: duplicate keys. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The problem arises when the `keyExtractor` function doesn't provide unique keys for each item, leading to unpredictable behavior and rendering issues.  This example highlights the importance of proper key management in FlatList for optimal performance and accuracy.
