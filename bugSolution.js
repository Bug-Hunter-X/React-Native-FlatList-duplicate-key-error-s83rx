To fix this error, ensure that your `keyExtractor` function always returns a unique key for every item in your data array.  Consider using a UUID library or generating unique keys based on a combination of fields, rather than relying on a single field that might have duplicates.  Here's a corrected implementation:

```javascript
import { uuid } from 'uuidv4'; // You might need to install: npm install uuidv4

const data = [{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }];

<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item) => uuid()}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

This revised version utilizes the `uuid` library to generate a globally unique identifier for each item, effectively resolving the duplicate key issue.
